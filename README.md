# Crindo-Utility
A tiny Mac app (my first) that I created to help me with my work at Crindo.

## Current functionality:
- Click the 'Copy Date to Clipboard' button to copy the current date-time ( + 15 seconds) to your clipboard in the "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ" format. eg: 2016-11-23T13:11:50 will be saved to your clipboard if the button is clicked on 23rd November 2016 at 1:11 PM.


(**Note**: This is my first Mac app. I created it since I was tired of typing the time in the aforementioned format in my textfield where date-time pickers wouldn't show up in Safari. Over time I may add more tools to this tool for further convenience in my work on my iOS app. *By no means is this production quality software*, nor does it adhere to Apple's HIG.)

Thanks for your time.
